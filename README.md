## Online Travel Agency Dashboard
# Background
The Online Travel Agency (OTA) industry plays a vital role in modern tourism by allowing customers to easily compare and book flights, hotels, and travel packages online. However, to remain competitive, OTAs must understand customer behavior, pricing trends, and market dynamics.
This project leverages Power BI to create a comprehensive, interactive dashboard that turns raw booking data into clear, actionable insights for business decision-makers.
# Objectives
•	To analyze OTA performance across bookings, revenue, and customer demographics
•	To visualize key patterns such as booking windows, top destinations, and seasonal demand
•	To segment customers based on age, income, and preferences
•	To help businesses optimize marketing, pricing, and inventory strategies
# Dataset Overview
•	Source: Kaggle (simulated OTA dataset)
•	Records Include:
o	Flight & hotel bookings
o	Customer information
o	Travel insurance preferences
o	Geographic and pricing data
# Project Highlights
•	Data preprocessing using Power Query (handling nulls, duplicates, type formatting)
•	Data modeling with relationships across bookings, customers, and services
•	DAX measures to calculate revenue, average value, booking trends, and segmentation
•	Drill-downs and filters for user-driven insights (by month, region, age group, service type)
•	Dashboard navigation for focused views (Main Page, Revenue, Travel Map, Insurance, Key Influencers)
# Visualizations Used
•	Line Charts – Booking trends by month
